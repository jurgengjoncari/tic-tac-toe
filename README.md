# Tic Tac Toe

This is the Tic-tac-toe game from [The Odin Project Full-stack JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe).

The game is played between two users. In the future, I'll implement the option to play against the AI to.

To play, start by choosing a position in the table. Whoever starts first, is the "X" mark. When the game is over, the result is announced by dialog and the game is restarted automatically.
