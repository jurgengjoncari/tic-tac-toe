## The game
###### Whoever fills three cells in a row wins, otherwise it's a draw

#### Objects
- Board
    - diagonals
        - left
        - right
- marks:
    - "X"
    - "O"
- Players
    - name
    - mark
    - position

1. A player enters their name and chooses one mark
2. The other player enters their name and the left mark is assigned to them


#### Input
1. The player that has the turn chooses a free position
2. If the position is not free, repeat step 1

#### The row it's in
###### Takes as input the player input (mark), returns the row it's in
- horizontal row
    : a list with three elements of the same row as the players' input.
- vertical row
    : a list with all three elements of the same column as the players' input.

#### Check three in a row
###### Takes as input the player input (mark), returns true if that mark is three times in one row
- it is true if at least one is true:
    - if two others are in the same vertical row
    - if two others are in the same horizontal row
    - if it's in one of the diagonals and two others are in that diagonal
- else, it's false.

#### Check if no empty cells
by default all cells have a value of undefined
if no cells have undefined as value, all cells are chosen

#### Check for draw
If no empty cells in gameboard

#### Check if the player won
###### Takes as input the player input, outputs true if the player won
If there's the same mark three times in the player's row, return the player's name.

#### Check if game is over
###### Takes as input the player input, outputs true if game is over
- it's over if:
    - the player won
    - it's a draw
- Else, the game isn't over

#### Change turn
1. First is X
2. if one player just chose, return the other player

## Game logic (main)
1. The player who's turn is, chooses position
4. If the game is over:
    1. log the result, 
    2. empty board, 
    3. restart the game if the user requests
6. Else, change turn and repeat

## Start game with whichever player has the mark "X"
